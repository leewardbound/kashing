== Kashing plugin for Rails 3

A functional, additive approach to model-based Rails 3 caching with Redis.

Usage is designed to be simple:

  class RocketShip < ActiveRecord::Base
    # Add Kashing to existing fields
    # Cached values are JSON serialized then saved into Redis
    kashing :title  

    # You can even define a function, letting you add Kashing almost anywhere
    kashing :people_on_board do self.riders.map {|p| p.name } end 

    # Use a custom TTL
    kashing :time_since_launch, :ttl => 10 do
      puts "Recalculating time since launch..."
      (Time.now - self.launched_at).to_i
    end 
  end

Here's how we use it after it's been added to the model

  irb> # Setup our rocketship
  irb> r=RocketShip.new :title => 'Admiral Nelson', :launched_at = Time.now
  irb> r.riders += User.first
  irb> r.launched_at
  => Mon Jan 17 18:52:31 -0800 2011
  irb> r.save

  irb> # Let's show SQL queries, so we know what's being cached
  irb> ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new STDOUT

  irb> # Using Kashing --
  irb> r = RocketShip.first
  RocketShip Load (0.6ms) SELECT `rocketship`.* from `rocketships` LIMIT 1

  irb> r.title_kashing # Get the Kash value by adding "_kashing"
  => 'Admiral Nelson' 

  irb> RocketShip.first_name_kashing(1) # Find it by ID
  => 'Admiral Nelson'

  irb> RocketShip.clear_first_name(1) # If the value isn't found in the kash
  nil
  irb> RocketShip.first_name_kashing(1) # Kashing will load the object
  RocketShip Load (0.6ms) SELECT `rocketship`.* from `rocketships` LIMIT 1
  => 'Admiral Nelson'


  irb> r.launched_at_kashing # Use :time => true for Time values
  => Mon Jan 17 18:52:31 -0800 2011

  irb> r.people_on_board_kashing # The first time will hit the database
  User Load (0.6ms) SELECT `user`.* from `users` WHERE (`user`.`id` IN (1))
  => ['Fred']
  irb> r.people_on_board_kashing # But subsequent calls will not!
  => ['Fred']
  irb> r.riders.delete_all 
  irb> r.people_on_board_kashing # Be careful of this!
  => ['Fred']
  irb> r.clear_people_on_board # Clear the Kashing value for :people_on_board
  irb> r.people_on_board_kashing
  User Load (0.6ms) SELECT `user`.* from `users` WHERE (`user`.`id` IN (1))
  => []

  irb> r.time_since_launch_kashing.to_i # Suppose we launched 3s ago
  Recalculating time since launch...
  => 3 
  irb> Time.sleep(5)
  irb> r.time_since_launch_kashing.to_i # TTL has not expired yet, still "3"
  => 3
  irb> Time.sleep(10)
  irb> r.time_since_launch_kashing.to_i # We launched 18s ago
  Recalculating time since launch...
  => 18
